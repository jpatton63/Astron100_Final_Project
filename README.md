This repository contains the edited down contents of most of my work. I included in this repository only what I used in my Model or data reduction, but there are a significant number of files from my workflow that were mostly trial and error, which I did not include so you would not have to comb through them. Thank you all again!

Guide to using this code:
1. All code files titled after an object are identical, but individual customized to that object.
2. To reproduce, you must download my objeect files, including bias, flats and comps. Then, you may run the individual files.
3. To download the training objects, run the downloading files. This is with the exception of BL Lac objects, which were downloaded from ZBLLAC (included in refs).
4. Finally, if the proper files have been downloaded, please feel free to test the model. I would adjust the epochs to 100 prior to testing, but 10 is sufficient for a quick attempt.
